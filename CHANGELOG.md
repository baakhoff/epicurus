# Changelog

All notable changes to epicurus are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

`v0.1.0` is the first release — the first version usable on a server with a UI.

A release is cut by pushing a semver tag (`git tag v0.1.0 && git push origin
v0.1.0`); GitHub Actions then publishes the GitHub Release and versioned container
images to GHCR.

## [Unreleased]

**Phase 2 (knowledge & storage) and Phase 3 (web search + Google integrations)** —
the platform grows from the core runtime into a module fleet. Targeted for the next
bundled-stack release, **v0.2.0**.

### Added

- **Knowledge module** — Obsidian-vault RAG: incremental ingestion into Qdrant and a
  `knowledge_search` retrieval tool for the agent. epicurus also indexes its own
  `docs/` tree by default, so the assistant can answer questions about the platform
  (ADR-0013).
- **Storage module** — indexes the on-disk file tree with browse / search / download
  APIs and agent file tools, plus a **MinIO** object store for app-managed objects.
- **Web search** — self-hosted **SearXNG** with a `web_search` MCP tool.
- **Connected accounts (OAuth 2.0)** — core-managed Authorization-Code flow with a
  per-tenant token vault and transparent refresh, plus a "Connected accounts"
  Settings screen to connect / disconnect providers and grant scopes incrementally.
  Modules fetch tokens through the platform API and never hold client secrets
  (ADR-0020).
- **Calendar module** — provider-neutral calendar with **local** and **Google**
  providers behind one tool surface (ADR-0016).
- **Mail module** — Gmail provider v0.1: `mail_search`, `mail_read`, `mail_send`.
- **Tasks module** — provider-neutral tasks (`tasks_list`, `tasks_add`,
  `tasks_complete`) with **local** and **Google** providers (ADR-0016).
- **Platform inference API** — `embed` + `chat` over the core LLM gateway, exposed to
  modules through `PlatformClient`; modules never call models directly.
- **Versioning policy** — per-component SemVer plus a bundled-stack release tag;
  every PR and dispatch brief declares its version bump (ADR-0017).
- **Runtime smoke gate** — CI boots the whole stack on every PR and asserts the
  integration last mile (image tags, mounts, module discovery, one MCP round-trip),
  catching breakage that lint and `compose config` miss (ADR-0015).

### Changed

- **Persistent secrets** — OpenBao moves from dev (in-memory) mode to file storage
  with an init / unseal lifecycle, so provider keys and module config survive a
  restart (ADR-0014). Resolves the v0.1.0 "secrets are not yet persistent" limitation.
- **Documentation** — a navigable `docs/` tree with a page per service / module and a
  full reference section (ADR-0013).

### Fixed

- Stability fixes across the data plane and modules: the MinIO client image tag,
  knowledge `mtime_ns` stored as `BigInteger`, the OpenBao bootstrap
  (init / unseal / policy / token), the SearXNG image tag and settings mount, and the
  pytest `importlib` import mode.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-12

**Phase 1 — the core runtime.** The platform runs end to end: chat from a phone with
a local or hosted model that calls tools and remembers across sessions.

### Added

- **Agent** — a thin MCP tool-calling loop with streaming chat (SSE).
- **LLM gateway** — one provider-agnostic interface over local **Ollama** and hosted
  providers (Claude, ChatGPT, Grok, DeepSeek, Gemini, and any OpenAI-compatible
  endpoint): routing, fallback chains, and tenant-scoped usage accounting. Keys live
  in OpenBao, never in env or logs.
- **Power states** (Active / Idle / Paused) with idle model unload (ADR-0005).
- **Cross-chat memory** — conversation history in Postgres plus semantic recall over
  Qdrant embeddings, scoped per tenant.
- **Web UI shell** — a phone-first PWA (chat, model manager, provider keys, power
  toggle) that renders each module's UI declaratively from its manifest (ADR-0007).
- **Module manifest UI** — `UiSection` / `UiAction`, served at `GET /manifest`.

### Known limitations

An early `0.x` release for personal / self-host use:

- **Secrets are not yet persistent** — OpenBao runs in dev (in-memory) mode, so
  provider keys and module config are lost when the `openbao` container restarts.
  Persistent secret storage lands in Phase 3.
- **The event bus has no authentication** — NATS tenant isolation is cooperative
  (fine single-user, not multi-tenant). Tracked in #50.
- **No perimeter is bundled** — the edge gateway only routes; put your own access
  layer (VPN / reverse proxy / auth proxy) in front (ADR-0008).
