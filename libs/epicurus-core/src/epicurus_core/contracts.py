result shapes used across the platform (ADR-0021).

The core's LLM gateway, its module-facing platform API, and the typed
``PlatformClient`` that modules call all speak the same two shapes:

* :class:`ChatMessage` — one message in a chat exchange (request side).
* :class:`ChatResult` — a non-streaming chat completion (response side).

Both live here so there is exactly one definition; ``epicurus_core_app`` imports
them rather than redefining its own. ``PlatformMessage`` and
``PlatformChatResponse`` are retained as backward-compatible aliases so existing
module code (``from epicurus_core import PlatformMessage``) keeps working.
